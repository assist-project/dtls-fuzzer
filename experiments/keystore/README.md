These are the keys/certs used during learning experiments, which are mostly imported from TLS-Attacker. 
It is important that these are consistent with the explicit keypair which appears in the sul/tls-attacker configuration file, otherwise client authentication may fail due to bad certificates.

For no particular reason, the java key store is protected by password "student", and has at alias "tls-attacker" a keypair comprising tls-attacker's RSA2048 key/cert.

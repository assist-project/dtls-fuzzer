Hence, 5000 tests. Something went wrong with exporting statistics. 

Also note that we didn't use the (apparently broken) SULCache provided by LearnLib. This is because the cache generated exceptions
in several previous learning runs. The logs/models of one of these runs are found in the folder FAILED_PREV_RUN.

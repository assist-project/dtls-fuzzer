Model observations:
GnuTLS 
    - responds to most messages with HelloVerify (even those that aren't clienthello's)
OpenSSL 
    - does not always terminate upon receiving alert messages

We changed the parameters slightly so one can provide ciphersuites with which to instantiate the learning alphabet.
This means to replicate experiments, we drop the prefix RSA_ from the input strings and instead specify  
TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA as cipher (which is what was used for experiments thus far).

This change was actually rolled back after some consideration, might still be a good idea, especially in view of 
merging to main.

Learning was performed on an adapted version of GNUTLS in which the constant
DTLS_RETRANS_TIMEOUT was set to 100000 (a large value). This change
required editing 'src/gnutls_int.h'.

OpenSSL was adjusted so as to increase the DTLS timeout from 1 second to 10.
This removed non-determinism which occurred in longer traces, or when using client-side certificates.
The change was made by adjusting 'timeout_duration_us' in 'ssl/d1_lib.c' to 10000000.
